# String processing algorithms

## Introduction

The Swift standard library's string processing algorithms are underpowered compared to other popular programming and scripting languages. Some of these omissions can be papered over through bridged `NSString` API available through the Foundation framework, but these are still incomplete and bring in linkage requirements to Foundation.

We propose:

1. New regex-powered algorithms over strings, bringing the standard library up to parity with scripting languages
2. Generic `Collection` equivalents of these algorithms in terms of subsequences
3. `protocol CustomRegexComponent`, allowing libraries to vend types that can be intermixed as components of regexes

This proposal is part of a larger [regex-powered string processing initiative](https://forums.swift.org/t/declarative-string-processing-overview/52459). Throughout the document, we will reference the still-in-progress [`RegexProtocol`, `Regex`](https://github.com/apple/swift-experimental-string-processing/blob/main/Documentation/Evolution/StronglyTypedCaptures.md), and [result builder DSL](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-regular-expression-literals/52820), but these are in flux and not formally part of this proposal. Further discussion of regex specifics is out of scope of this proposal and better discussed in another thread (see [Pitch and Proposal Status](https://github.com/apple/swift-experimental-string-processing/issues/107) for links to relevant threads).

## Motivation

Here is how [Python string processing API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str) compares to their counterparts in Swift standard library. 

Note: The comparison table omits functions to query if all characters in the string are of a specified category, such as `isalnum()` and `isalpha()`. These are achievable in Swift by passing in the corresponding character set to `allSatisfy(_:)`. 

|Python |Swift  |Note|
|---    |---    |--- |
|center(width, fillchar)|  |  |
|count(sub, start, end)|  |  |
|endswith(suffix, start, end)|hasSuffix(:)| `hasSuffix(:)` does not support searching from a given index| 
|expandtabs(tabsize)|  |  |
|find(sub, start, end)|firstIndex(where:)|`firstIndex(:)` only searches for a single character, and is limited to whole range only|
|index(sub, start, end)|firstIndex(where:)|  |
|join(iterable)|reduce(:nextPartialResult:)|  |
|ljust(width, fillchar)|  |  |
|lstrip([chars])|  |  |
|maketrans(x, y, z)|  |  |
|partition(sep)|  |  |
|removeprefix(prefix)|  |  |
|removesuffix(suffix)|  |  |
|replace(old, new, count)|  | |
|rfind(sub, start, end)|lastIndex(where:)|  |
|rindex(sub, start, end)|lastIndex(where:)|  |
|rjust(width, fillchar)|  |  |
|rpartition(sep)|  |  |
|rsplit(sep, maxsplit)|  |  |
|rstrip([chars])|  |  |
|split(sep, maxsplit)|split(separator:maxSplits:omittingEmptySubsequences:)|  |
|splitlines(keepends)|split(separator:maxSplits:omittingEmptySubsequences:)|  |
|startswith(prefix, start, end)|starts(with:)|  |  |
|strip([chars])|  |  |
|translate(table)|  |  |
|zfill(width)|  |  |


Many essential string processing APIs are evidently missing in the standard library, which motivates this proposal.

### Processing domain-specific strings

Processing strings that requires domain specific information is a common task. Consider parsing the date field `"Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 23:53:19 GMT"` in an HTTP header as a `Date` type. A common approach is to match a substring that look like a date string (`16 Feb 2022`), and post-process the substring as a `Date` using one of the date parsers in the Foundation:

```swift
let regex = Regex {
    capture {
        oneOrMore(.digit)
        " "
        oneOrMore(.word)
        " "
        oneOrMore(.digit)
    }
}

let dateParser = Date.ParseStrategy(format: "\(day: .twoDigits) \(month: .abbreviated) \(year: .padded(4))"
if let dateMatch = header.firstMatch(of: regex)?.0 {
    let date = try? Date(dateMatch, strategy: dateParser)
}
```

While this approach happens to work for this example, it is fragile when it comes to localized strings. 

Or consider parsing a bank statement to record all the monetary values in the last column:

```swift
let statement = """
CREDIT    04/06/2020    Paypal transfer    $4.99
CREDIT    04/03/2020    Payroll            $69.73
DEBIT     04/02/2020    ACH transfer       ($38.25)
DEBIT     03/24/2020    IRX tax payment    ($52,249.98)
"""
```

Parsing a currency string such as `$3,020.85` with regex is also tricky, as it can contain localized and currency symbols. This is why Foundation provides industrial-strength parsers for localized strings like these. 

We propose a `CustomRegexComponent` protocol which allows types from outside the standard library participate in regex builders and `RegexProtocol` algorithms. This allows types, such as `Date.ParseStrategy` and `FloatingPointFormatStyle.Currency`, to be used directly within a regex:

```swift
let dateRegex = Regex {
    capture(dateParser)
}

let date = header.firstMatch(of: dateRegex).map(\.result.1) 
// A `Date` representing 2022-02-16 00:00:00 +0000

let currencyRegex = Regex {
    capture(.localizedCurrency(code: "USD").sign(strategy: .accounting))
}

let amount = statement.matches(of: currencyRegex).map(\.result.1)
// [4.99, 69.73, -38.25, -52249.98]
```


## Proposed solution and detailed design 

### String algorithm additions

The following regex-powered algorithms as well as their generic `Collection` equivalents are included in this pitch:

#### Contains

```swift
extension Collection where Element: Equatable {
    /// Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the collection contains the
    /// given sequence.
    /// - Parameter other: A sequence to search for within this collection.
    /// - Returns: `true` if the collection contains the specified sequence,
    /// otherwise `false`.
    public func contains<S: Sequence>(_ other: S) -> Bool
        where S.Element == Element
}

extension BidirectionalCollection where SubSequence == Substring {
    /// Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the collection contains the
    /// given regex.
    /// - Parameter regex: A regex to search for within this collection.
    /// - Returns: `true` if the regex was found in the collection, otherwise
    /// `false`.
    public func contains<R: RegexProtocol>(_ regex: R) -> Bool
}
```

#### Starts with

```swift
extension BidirectionalCollection where SubSequence == Substring {
    /// Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the
    /// sequence are the same as the elements in the specified regex.
    /// - Parameter regex: A regex to compare to this sequence.
    /// - Returns: `true` if the initial elements of the sequence matches the
    /// beginning of `regex`; otherwise, `false`.
    public func starts<R: RegexProtocol>(with regex: R) -> Bool
}
```

#### Trim prefix

```swift
extension Collection {
    /// Returns a new collection of the same type by removing initial elements
    /// that satisfy the given predicate from the start.
    /// - Parameter predicate: A closure that takes an element of the sequence
    /// as its argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the
    /// element should be removed from the collection.
    /// - Returns: A collection containing the elements of the collection that are
    ///  not removed by `predicate`.
    public func trimmingPrefix(while predicate: (Element) -> Bool) -> SubSequence
}

extension Collection where SubSequence == Self {
    /// Removes the initial elements that satisfy the given predicate from the
    /// start of the sequence.
    /// - Parameter predicate: A closure that takes an element of the sequence
    /// as its argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the
    /// element should be removed from the collection.
    public mutating func trimPrefix(while predicate: (Element) -> Bool)
}

extension RangeReplaceableCollection {
    /// Removes the initial elements that satisfy the given predicate from the
    /// start of the sequence.
    /// - Parameter predicate: A closure that takes an element of the sequence
    /// as its argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the
    /// element should be removed from the collection.
    public mutating func trimPrefix(while predicate: (Element) -> Bool)
}

extension Collection where Element: Equatable {
    /// Returns a new collection of the same type by removing `prefix` from the
    /// start.
    /// - Parameter prefix: The collection to remove from this collection.
    /// - Returns: A collection containing the elements that does not match
    /// `prefix` from the start.
    public func trimmingPrefix<Prefix: Collection>(_ prefix: Prefix) -> SubSequence
        where Prefix.Element == Element
}

extension Collection where SubSequence == Self, Element: Equatable {
    /// Removes the initial elements that matches `prefix` from the start.
    /// - Parameter prefix: The collection to remove from this collection.
    public mutating func trimPrefix<Prefix: Collection>(_ prefix: Prefix)
        where Prefix.Element == Element
}

extension RangeReplaceableCollection where Element: Equatable {
    /// Removes the initial elements that matches `prefix` from the start.
    /// - Parameter prefix: The collection to remove from this collection.
    public mutating func trimPrefix<Prefix: Collection>(_ prefix: Prefix)
        where Prefix.Element == Element
}

extension BidirectionalCollection where SubSequence == Substring {
    /// Returns a new subsequence by removing the initial elements that matches
    /// the given regex.
    /// - Parameter regex: The regex to remove from this collection.
    /// - Returns: A new subsequence containing the elements of the collection
    /// that does not match `prefix` from the start.
    public func trimmingPrefix<R: RegexProtocol>(_ regex: R) -> SubSequence
}

extension RangeReplaceableCollection
  where Self: BidirectionalCollection, SubSequence == Substring
{
    /// Removes the initial elements that matches the given regex.
    /// - Parameter regex: The regex to remove from this collection.
    public mutating func trimPrefix<R: RegexProtocol>(_ regex: R)
}
```

#### First range

```swift
extension Collection where Element: Equatable {
    /// Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given sequence
    /// within the collection.
    /// - Parameter sequence: The sequence to search for.
    /// - Returns: A range in the collection of the first occurrence of `sequence`.
    /// Returns nil if `sequence` is not found.
    public func firstRange<S: Sequence>(of sequence: S) -> Range<Index>? 
        where S.Element == Element
}

extension BidirectionalCollection where Element: Comparable {
    /// Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given sequence
    /// within the collection.
    /// - Parameter other: The sequence to search for.
    /// - Returns: A range in the collection of the first occurrence of `sequence`.
    /// Returns `nil` if `sequence` is not found.
    public func firstRange<S: Sequence>(of other: S) -> Range<Index>?
        where S.Element == Element
}

extension BidirectionalCollection where SubSequence == Substring {
    /// Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given regex
    /// within the collection.
    /// - Parameter regex: The regex to search for.
    /// - Returns: A range in the collection of the first occurrence of `regex`.
    /// Returns `nil` if `regex` is not found.
    public func firstRange<R: RegexProtocol>(of regex: R) -> Range<Index>?
}
```

#### Ranges

```swift
extension Collection where Element: Equatable {
    /// Finds and returns the ranges of the all occurrences of a given sequence
    /// within the collection.
    /// - Parameter other: The sequence to search for.
    /// - Returns: A collection of ranges of all occurrences of `other`. Returns
    ///  an empty collection if `other` is not found.
    public func ranges<S: Sequence>(of other: S) -> some Collection<Range<Index>>
        where S.Element == Element
}

extension BidirectionalCollection where SubSequence == Substring {
    /// Finds and returns the ranges of the all occurrences of a given sequence
    /// within the collection.
    /// - Parameter regex: The regex to search for.
    /// - Returns: A collection or ranges in the receiver of all occurrences of
    /// `regex`. Returns an empty collection if `regex` is not found.
    public func ranges<R: RegexProtocol>(of regex: R) -> some Collection<Range<Index>>
}
```

#### First match

```swift
extension BidirectionalCollection where SubSequence == Substring {
    /// Returns the first match of the specified regex within the collection.
    /// - Parameter regex: The regex to search for.
    /// - Returns: The first match of `regex` in the collection, or `nil` if
    /// there isn't a match.
    public func firstMatch<R: RegexProtocol>(of regex: R) -> RegexMatch<R.Match>?
}
```

#### Matches

extension BidirectionalCollection where SubSequence == Substring {
    /// Returns a collection containing all matches of the specified regex.
    /// - Parameter regex: The regex to search for.
    /// - Returns: A collection of matches of `regex`.
    public func matches<R: RegexProtocol>(of regex: R) -> some Collection<RegexMatch<R.Match>>
}
```

#### Replace

```swift
extension RangeReplaceableCollection where Element: Equatable {
    /// Returns a new collection in which all occurrences of a target sequence
    /// are replaced by another collection.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - other: The sequence to replace.
    ///   - replacement: The new elements to add to the collection.
    ///   - subrange: The range in the collection in which to search for `other`.
    ///   - maxReplacements: A number specifying how many occurrences of `other`
    ///   to replace. Default is `Int.max`.
    /// - Returns: A new collection in which all occurrences of `other` in
    /// `subrange` of the collection are replaced by `replacement`.    public func replacing<S: Sequence, Replacement: Collection>(
        _ other: S,
        with replacement: Replacement,
        subrange: Range<Index>,
        maxReplacements: Int = .max
    ) -> Self where S.Element == Element, Replacement.Element == Element
  
    /// Returns a new collection in which all occurrences of a target sequence

    public func replacing<S: Sequence, Replacement: Collection>(
        _ other: S,
        with replacement: Replacement,
        maxReplacements: Int = .max
    ) -> Self where S.Element == Element, Replacement.Element == Element
  
    /// Replaces all occurrences of a target sequence with a given collection
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - other: The sequence to replace.
    ///   - replacement: The new elements to add to the collection.
    ///   - maxReplacements: A number specifying how many occurrences of `other`

    public mutating func replace<S: Sequence, Replacement: Collection>(

    ) where S.Element == Element, Replacement.Element == Element
}

    public mutating func replace<R: RegexProtocol, Replacement: Collection>(
        _ regex: R,
        with replacement: Replacement,
        maxReplacements: Int = .max
    ) where Replacement.Element == Element
  
    public func replacing<R: RegexProtocol, Replacement: Collection>(
        _ regex: R,
        with replacement: (RegexMatch<R.Match>) throws -> Replacement,

        with replacement: (RegexMatch<R.Match>) throws -> Replacement,
        maxReplacements: Int = .max
    ) rethrows where Replacement.Element == Element
}
```

#### Split

```swift
extension Collection where Element: Equatable {
    /// Returns the longest possible subsequences of the collection, in order,
    /// around elements equal to the given separator.
    /// - Parameter separator: The element to be split upon.
    /// - Returns: A collection of subsequences, split from this collection's
    /// elements.
    public func split<S: Sequence>(by separator: S) -> some Collection<SubSequence>
        where S.Element == Element
}

extension BidirectionalCollection where SubSequence == Substring {
    /// Returns the longest possible subsequences of the collection, in order,
    /// around elements equal to the given separator.
    /// - Parameter separator: A regex describing elements to be split upon.
    /// - Returns: A collection of substrings, split from this collection's
    /// elements.
    public func split<R: RegexProtocol>(by separator: R) -> some Collection<Substring>
}
```


### `CustomRegexComponent`

`CustomRegexComponent` inherits from `RegexProtocol` and satisfies its sole requirement. 

```swift
public protocol CustomRegexComponent: RegexProtocol {
    /// Match the input string within the specified bounds, beginning at the given index, and return
    /// the end position (upper bound) of the match and the matched instance.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - input: The string in which the match is performed.
    ///   - index: An index of `input` at which to begin matching.
    ///   - bounds: The bounds in `input` in which the match is performed.
    /// - Returns: The upper bound where the match terminates and a matched instance, or `nil` if
    ///   there isn't a match.
    func match(
        _ input: String,
        startingAt index: String.Index,
        in bounds: Range<String.Index>
    ) -> (upperBound: String.Index, match: Match)?
}
```

Conformers naturally inherit from `RegexProtocol`, so they can be used with all of the string algorithms generic over `RegexProtocol`.

Here, we use Foundation `FloatingPointFormatStyle<Double>.Currency` as an example. `FloatingPointFormatStyle<Double>.Currency` would conform to `CustomRegexComponent` by implementing the `match` function, with `Match` being a `Double`. It could also add a static function `.localizedCurrency(code:)` as a member of `RegexProtocol`, so you can refer to it as `.localizedCurrency(code:)` in the `Regex` result builder:

```swift
extension FloatingPointFormatStyle<Double>.Currency : CustomRegexComponent { 
    public func match(
        _ input: String,
        startingAt index: String.Index,
        in bounds: Range<String.Index>
    ) -> (upperBound: String.Index, match: Double)?
}

extension RegexProtocol where Self == FloatingPointFormatStyle<Double>.Currency {
    public static func localizedCurrency(code: Locale.Currency) -> Self
}
```

Matching and extracting a localized currency amount, such as `"$3,020.85"`, can be done directly within a regex:

```swift
let regex = Regex {
    capture(.localizedCurreny(code: "USD"))
}
```


## Alternatives considered

### Extend `Sequence` instead of `Collection`

All of the proposed algorithms are specific to the `Collection` protocol, without support for plain `Sequence`s. Types conforming to the `Sequence` protocol are not required to support multi-pass iteration, which makes a `Sequence` conformance insufficient for most of these algorithms. In light of this, the decision was made to have the underlying shared algorithm implementations work exclusively with `Collection`s.

## Future directions

### Backward algorithms

There are some unanswered questions about algorithms that operate from the back of a collection.

There is a subtle difference between finding the last non-overlapping range of a pattern in a string, and finding the first range of this pattern when searching from the back. `"aaaaa".ranges(of: "aa")` produces two non-overlapping ranges, splitting the string in the chunks `aa|aa|a`. It would not be completely unreasonable to expect `"aaaaa".lastRange(of: "aa")` to be shorthand for `"aaaaa".ranges(of: "aa").last`, i.e. to return the range that contains the third and fourth characters of the string. Yet, the first range of `"aa"` when searching from the back of the string yields the range that contains the fourth and fifth characters.

It is not obvious whether both of these notions of what it means for a range to be the "last" range should be supported, or what names should be used in order to disambiguate them. It is also worth noting that some kinds of patterns do behave nicely and always produce the same results when searching forwards or backwards, e.g. `myInts.lastIndex(where: { $0 > 10 })` is unambiguous. These kinds of patterns might warrant special treatment when designing algorithms that process the collection in reverse.

Similar questions arise when trimming a string from both sides: `"ababa".trimming("aba")` can return either `"ba"` or `"ab"`, depending on whether the prefix or the suffix was trimmed first.

### Throwing closures

The closure parameters of `trimPrefix(while:)` and `replace(_:with:)` aren't marked `throws` and the methods themselves aren't marked `rethrows`, because the shared implementations of these groups of related algorithms do not yet support error handling.

### Open up the shared algorithm implementations for user-defined types

At this point we have not settled on a final design for the protocol hierarchy that the shared algorithm implementations rely on, so we are not ready to expose this infrastructure and stabilize the entire ABI. We aim to eventually open up the ability for users to pass their own types to these `Collection` algorithms without having to go through the `RegexProtocol` overload which creates an intermediate `Regex` instance.
