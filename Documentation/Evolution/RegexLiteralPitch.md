# Regular Expression Literals

- Authors: Hamish Knight, Michael Ilseman

## Introduction

We propose to introduce a first-class regular expression literal into the language that can take advantage of library support to offer extensible, powerful, and familiar textual pattern matching.

This is a component of a larger string processing picture. We would like to start a focused discussion surrounding our approach to the literal itself, while acknowledging that evaluating the utility of the literal will ultimately depend on the whole picture (e.g. supporting API). To aid this focused discussion, details such as the representation of captures in the type system, semantic details, extensions to lexing/parsing, additional API, etc., are out of scope of this pitch and thread. Feel free to continue discussion of anything related in the [overview thread][overview].

## Motivation

Regular expressions are a ubiquitous, familiar, and concise syntax for matching and extracting text that satisfies a particular pattern. Syntactically, a regex literal in Swift should:

- Support a syntax familiar to developers who have learned to use regular expressions in other tools and languages
- Allow reuse of many regular expressions not specifically designed for Swift (e.g. from Stack Overflow or popular programming books)
- Allow libraries to define custom types that can be constructed with regex literals, much like string literals
- Diagnose at compile time if a regex literal uses capabilities that aren't allowed by the type's regex dialect

Further motivation, examples, and discussion can be found in the [overview thread][overview].

## Proposed Solution

We propose the introduction of a regular expression literal that supports [the PCRE syntax][PCRE], in addition to new standard library protocols `ExpressibleByRegexLiteral` and `RegexLiteralProtocol` that allow for the customization of how the regex literal is interpreted (similar to [string interpolation][stringinterpolation]). The compiler will parse the PCRE syntax within a regex literal, and synthesize calls to corresponding builder methods. Types conforming to `ExpressibleByRegexLiteral` will be able to provide a builder type that opts into supporting various regex constructs through the use of normal function declarations and `@available`.

_Note: This pitch concerns language syntax and compiler changes alone, it isn't stating what features the stdlib should support in the initial version or in future versions._

## Detailed Design

A regular expression literal will be introduced using `/` delimiters, within which the compiler will parse [PCRE regex syntax][PCRE]:

```swift
// Matches "<identifier> = <hexadecimal value>", extracting the identifier and hex number
let regex = /([[:alpha:]]\w*) = ([0-9A-F]+)/
```

The above regex literal will be inferred to be the default regex literal type `Regex`. Errors in the regex will be diagnosed by the compiler.

_`Regex` here is a stand-in type, further details about the type such as if or how this will scale to strongly typed captures is still under investigation._

_How best to diagnose grapheme-semantic concerns is still under investigation and probably best discussed in their corresponding threads. For example, `Range<Character>` is not [countable][countable] and [ordering is not linguistically meaningful][ordering], so validating character class ranges may involve restricting to a semantically-meaningful range (e.g. ASCII). This is best discussed in the (upcoming) character class pitch/thread._

The compiler will then transform the literal into a set of builder calls that may be customized by adopting the `ExpressibleByRegexLiteral` protocol. Below is a straw-person transformation of this example: 

```swift
// let regex = /([[:alpha:]]\w*) = ([0-9A-F]+)/
let regex = {
  var builder = T.RegexLiteral()

  // __A4 = /([[:alpha:]]\w*)/
  let __A1 = builder.buildCharacterClass_POSIX_alpha()
  let __A2 = builder.buildCharacterClass_w()
  let __A3 = builder.buildConcatenate(__A1, __A2)
  let __A4 = builder.buildCaptureGroup(__A3)

  // __B1 = / = /
  let __B1 = builder.buildLiteral(" = ")

  // __C3 = /([0-9A-F]+)/
  let __C1 = builder.buildCustomCharacterClass(["0"..."9", "A"..."F"])
  let __C2 = builder.buildOneOrMore(__C1)
  let __C3 = builder.buildCaptureGroup(__C2)

  let __D1 = builder.buildConcatenate(__A4, __B1, __C3)
  return T(regexLiteral: builder.finalize(__D1))
}()
```

In this formulation, the compiler fully parses the regex literal, calling mutating methods on a builder which constructs an AST. Here, the compiler recognizes syntax such as ranges and classifies metacharacters (`buildCharacterClass_w()`). Alternate formulations could involve less reasoning (`buildMetacharacter_w`), or more (`builderCharacterClass_word`). We'd like community feedback on this approach.

Additionally, it may make sense for the stdlib to provide a `RegexLiteral` conformer that just constructs a string to pass off to a string-based library. Such a type might assume all features are supported unless communicated otherwise, and we'd like community feedback on mechanisms to communicate this (e.g. availability).

### The `ExpressibleByRegexLiteral` and `RegexLiteralProtocol` protocols

New `ExpressibleByRegexLiteral` and `RegexLiteralProtocol` protocols will be introduced to the standard library, and will serve a similar purpose to the existing literal protocols `ExpressibleByStringInterpolation` and `StringInterpolationProtocol`.

```swift
public protocol ExpressibleByRegexLiteral {
  associatedtype RegexLiteral : RegexLiteralProtocol = DefaultRegexLiteral
  init(regexLiteral: RegexLiteral)
}

public protocol RegexLiteralProtocol {
  init()

  // Informal builder requirements for building a regex literal
  // will be specified here.
}
```

Types conforming to `ExpressibleByRegexLiteral` will be able to provide a custom type that conforms to `RegexLiteralProtocol`, which will be used to build the resulting regex value. A default conforming type will be provided by the standard library (`DefaultRegexLiteral` here).

Libraries can extend regex handling logic for their domains. For example, a higher-level library could provide linguistically richer regular expressions by incorporating locale, collation, language dictionaries, and fuzzier matching. Similarly, libraries wrapping different regex engines (e.g. `NSRegularExpression`) can support custom regex literals.

### Opting into certain regex features

We intend for the compiler to completely parse [the PCRE syntax][PCRE]. However, types conforming to `RegexLiteralProtocol` might not be able to handle the full feature set. The compiler will look for corresponding function declarations inside `RegexLiteralProtocol` and will emit a compilation error if missing. Conforming types can use `@available` on these function declarations to communicate versioning and add more support in the future.

This approach of lookup combined with availability allows the stdlib to support more features over time.

### Impact of using `/` as the delimiter

#### On comment syntax

Single line comments use the syntax `//`, which would conflict with the spelling for an empty regex literal. As such, an empty regex literal would be forbidden.

While not conflicting with the syntax proposed in this pitch, it's also worth noting that the `//` comment syntax (in particular documentation comments that use `///`) would likely preclude the ability to use `///` as a delimiter if we ever wanted to support multi-line regex literals. It's possible though that future multi-line support could be provided through raw regex literals. Alternatively, it could be inferred from the regex options provided. For example, a regex that uses the multi-line option `/(?m)/` could be allowed to span multiple lines.

Multi-line comments use the `/*` delimiter. As such, a regex literal starting with `*` wouldn't be parsed. This however isn't a major issue as an unqualified `*` is already invalid regex syntax. An escaped `/\*/` regex literal wouldn't be impacted.

#### On custom infix operators using the `/` character

Choosing `/` as the delimiter means there will a conflict for infix operators containing `/` in cases where whitespace isn't used, for example:

```swift
x+/y/+z
```

Should the operators be parsed as `+/` and `/+` respectively, or should this be parsed as `x + /y/ + z`?

In this case, things can be disambiguated by the user inserting additional whitespace. We therefore could continue to parse `x+/y/+z` as a binary operator chain, and require additional whitespace to interpret `/y/` as a regex literal.

#### On custom prefix and postfix operators using the `/` character

There will also be parsing ambiguity with any user-defined prefix and postfix operators containing the `/` character. For example, code such as the following poses an issue:

```swift
let x = /0; let y = 1/
```

Should this be considered to be two `let` bindings, with each initialization expression using prefix and postfix `/` operators, or is it a single regex literal?

This also extends more generally to prefix and postfix operators containing the `/` character, e.g:

```swift
let x = </<0; let y = 1</<
```
Is this a regex literal `/<0; let y = 1</` with a prefix and postfix `<` operator applied, or two `let` bindings each using prefix and postfix `</<` operators?

There are no easy ways of resolving these ambiguities, therefore a regex literal parsed with `/` delimiters will likely need to be introduced under a new language version mode, along with a deprecation of prefix and postfix `/` operators. Some prefix and postfix operators containing `/` may be disambiguated with parenthesis, but we may have to figure out a way to refer to the operator explicitly or deprecate prefix and postfix (but not infix) operators containing `/`.

#### On the existing division operator `/`

The existing division operator `/` has less concerns than the above cases, however it raises some cases that currently parse as a sequence of binary operations, whereas the user might be expecting a regex literal.

For example:

```swift
extension Int {
  static func foo() -> Int { 0 }
}

let x = 0
/ 1 / .foo()
```

Today, this is parsed as a single binary operator chain `0 / 1 / .foo()`, with `.foo()` becoming an argument to the `/` operator. This is because while Swift does have some parser behavior that is affected by newlines, generally newlines are treated as whitespace, and expressions therefore may span multiple lines. However the user may well be expecting the second line to be parsed as a regex literal.

This is also potentially an issue for result builders, for example:

```swift
SomeBuilder {
  x
  / y /
  z
}
```

Today this is parsed as `SomeBuilder { x / y / z }`, however it's likely the user was expecting this to become a result builder with 3 elements, the second of which being a regex literal.

There is currently no source compatibility impact as both cases will continue to parse as binary operations. The user may insert a `;` on the prior line to get the desired regex literal parsing. However this may not be sufficient we may need to change parsing rules (under a version check) to favor parsing regex literals in these cases. We'd like to discuss this further with the community.

It's worth noting that this is similar to an ambiguity that already exists today with trailing closures, for example:

```swift
SomeBuilder {
  SomeType()
  { print("hello") }
  AnotherType()
}
```

`{ print("hello") }` will be parsed as a trailing closure to `SomeType()` rather than as a separate element to the result builder.

It can also currently arise with leading dot syntax in a result builder, e.g:

```swift
SomeBuilder {
  SomeType()
  .member
}
```

`.member` will be parsed as a member access on `SomeType()` rather than as a separate element that may have its base type inferred by the parameter of a `buildExpression` method on the result builder.


## Future Directions

### Typed captures

Typed captures would statically represent how many captures and of what kind are present in a regex literals. They could produce a `Substring` for a regular capture, `Substring?` for a zero-or-one capture, and  `Array<Substring>` (or a lazy collection) for a zero(or one)-or-more capture. These are worth exploring, especially in the context of the [start of variadic generics][variadics] support, but we'd like to keep this pitch and discussion focused to the details presented.

### Other regex literals

Multi-line extensions to regex literals is considered future work. Generally, we'd like to encourage refactoring into `Pattern` when the regex gets to that degree of complexity.

User-specified [choice of quote delimiters][perlquotes] is considered future work. A related approach to this could be a "raw" regex literal analogous to [raw strings][rawstrings]. For example (total strawperson), an approach where `n` `#`s before the opening delimiter would requires `n` `#` at the end of the trailing delimiter as well as requiring `n-1` `#`s to access metacharacters.

```txt
// All of the below are trying to match a path like "/tmp/foo/bar/File.app/file.txt"

/\/tmp\/.*\/File\.app\/file\.txt/
#//tmp/.*/File\.app/file\.txt/#
##//tmp/#.#*/File.app/file.txt/##
```

"Swiftier" literals, such as with non-semantic whitespace (e.g. [Raku's][rakuregex]), is future work. We'd want to strongly consider using a different backing technology for Swifty matching literals, such as PEGs.

Fully-custom literal support, that is literals whose bodies are not parsed and there is no default type available, is orthogonal to this work. It would require support for compilation-time Swift libraries in addition to Swift APIs for the compiler and type system.


### Further extension to Swift language constructs

Other language constructs, such as raw-valued enums, might benefit from further regex enhancements.

```swift
enum CalculatorToken: Regex {
  case wholeNumber = /\d+/
  case identifier = /\w+/
  case symbol = /\p{Math}/
  ...
}
```

As mentioned in the overview, general purpose extensions to Swift (syntactic) pattern matching could benefit regex

```swift
func parseField(_ field: String) -> ParsedField {
  switch field {
  case let text <- /#\s?(.*)/:
    return .comment(text)
  case let (l, u) <- /([0-9A-F]+)(?:\.\.([0-9A-F]+))?/:
    return .scalars(Unicode.Scalar(hex: l) ... Unicode.Scalar(hex: u ?? l))
  case let prop <- GraphemeBreakProperty.init:
    return .property(prop)
  }
}
```

### Other semantic details

Further details about the semantics of regex literals, such as what definition we give to character classes, the initial supported feature set, and how to switch between grapheme-semantic and scalar-semantic usage, is still under investigation and outside the scope of this discussion.

## Alternatives considered

### Using a different delimiter to `/`

As explored above, using `/` as the delimiter has the potential to conflict with existing operators using that character, and may necessitate:

- Changing of parsing rules around chained `/` over multiple lines
- Deprecating prefix and postfix operators containing the `/` character
- Requiring additional whitespace to disambiguate from infix operators containing `/`
- Requiring a new language version mode to parse the literal with `/` delimiters

However one of the main goals of this pitch is to introduce a familiar syntax for regular expression literals, which has been the motivation behind choices such as using the PCRE regex syntax. Given the fact that `/` is an existing term of art for regular expressions, we feel that if the aforementioned parsing issues can be solved in a satisfactory manner, we should prefer it as the delimiter.


### Reusing string literal syntax

Instead of supporting a first-class literal kind for regular expressions, we could instead allow users to write a regular expression in a string literal, and parse, diagnose, and generate the appropriate code when it's coerced to an `ExpressibleByRegexLiteral` conforming type.

```swift
let regex: Regex = "([[:alpha:]]\w*) = ([0-9A-F]+)"
```

However we decided against this because:

- We would not be able to easily apply custom syntax highlighting for the regex syntax
- It would require an `ExpressibleByRegexLiteral` contextual type to be treated as a regex, otherwise it would be defaulted to `String`, which may be undesired
- In an overloaded context it may be ambiguous whether a string literal is meant to be interpreted as a literal string or regex
- Regex escape sequences aren't currently compatible with string literal escape sequence rules, e.g `\w` is currently illegal in a string literal
- It wouldn't be compatible with other string literal features such as interpolations
